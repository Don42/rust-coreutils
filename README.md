# rust-coreutils
Most tutorials to learn a new language are not really realistic.
I my experiance the only way to learn anything new, is to have an
actual project.
So, this is my reimplementation of the unix coreutils in rust.
There are multiple implementations like it, but I wanted to start fresh.

I am unsure in which order these will be implemented, but suggestions are
welcome.
